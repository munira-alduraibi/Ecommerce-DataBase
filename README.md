# Ecommerce Database ðŸ’³

### What?
This project is about designing a datbase for a business of your choice, and it is meant for my DataBase I course.

#### The flow if the program as follows :
1. When the program runs it will show the user a number of options as follow :
    1. Cryptography
    2. Duplicate word
    3. Recursion
    4. Exit

2. When the user chooses the **Cryptography** option, he/she can choose from the following :
    1. encoding â†’ here the user will be asked to enter a string and the program will cipher it.
    2. decoding  â†’ here the user will be asked to enter a string and the program will decipher it.
    3. EXIT 
 * *NOTE : it will be ciphered and deciphered depending on the number entered by the user to move the string according to the alphabet.*

3. When the user chooses the **Duplicate word** option, she/he will enter a sentence and the program will check if there is a duplicate word in the same entered sentence using circular linked list.
For example, 
    * If the user entered "alex eats apple dose that means that she likes apple?" the program will output the following "There is a duplicate word". 
    * Otherwise if no duplicate words existed it will output "There is no duplicate word".

4. When the user chooses the **Recursion** option, the user will be asked to enter a sentence that will be reversed using singly linked list and recursion.
For example, 
    * If the user entered "alex eats apple" the program will output the following "apple eats alex".
    
5. When the user chooses the **EXIT** option in the sub menu it will return him/her to the main menu, and then if he/she chooses the **EXIT** option in the main menu it will terminate the program.

### Why?
This small project is meant for our data structure class. and the main objectives are :
* Getting the practical knowledge of arrays and several types of linked lists.
* Learning the real-life application of linked lists, arrays and recursion.
