# Database for Ecommerce store ðŸ’³

## What?
Hereâ€™s is a simple database for an Ecommerce store that sells coffee beans and Equipments. The main objective of this project is to find an idea and to draw the needed notations and then converted them to an ER model [as shown below](#chens-notation) and then after that writing [the SQL commands](e_commerce.sql) needed to create the database, tables, and some other commands to query and minplate the data.

### Business Rules 

The online store sells different PRODUCTs of coffee beans and tools each product has a name, and a unique product_serial_number, each product has the following additional attributes: a product_price. and the product production_date, and expiry_date, and
 product_quantity which used with the product_serial_number to distinguish which products is ordered and which is in the inventory. 

The online store keeps records of all previous customers, for marketing reasons, therefore each customer may or may not submit an order and may or may not issue an invoice, The identifier for CUSTOMER is customer_id and other attributes are name and address, each customer has one address, each CUSTOMER can place one or many ORDERS, 

The identifier for an order is order_id ,and other attributes are order_time and order status, each ORDER contain one or more PRODUCTs, 
many ORDERs is made by one EMPLOYEE .

The identifier for INVOICE is the invoice_number, and other attributes are invoice_date, and the total,  each INVOICE include one ORDER, and one or more INVOICE is issued for one CUSTOMER 

The online coffee store has several EMPLOYEEs the identifier for an employee is employee_id , other attributes include a specific position, phone number.

The identifier for SECTIONs is a section_name, and every SECTION consists of products.

# What I learned?
* To write business rules and scenarios that are logically correct.
* To draw Entity Relationship Model forom the scenarios to Chenâ€™s and UML notations.
* To correctly translate (map) the ER diagram into a relational model.
* To correctly normalize the relational schema.
* To initiate MySQL connection 
* To write all the commands needed for the database whether it is Data Definition, Data Manipulation, or Data Control commands.
